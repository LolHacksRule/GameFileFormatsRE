# GameFileFormatsRE
A collection of scripts I made in my own time that may help with reversing and/or getting more info on game files using these formats. If you want to help me finish off a format, please let me know so you get credited.

If using the Noesis scripts to read Wii textures, it may be required to use the [Nintex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zheneq/Noesis-Plugins/master/lib_zq_nintendo_tex.py) library.
